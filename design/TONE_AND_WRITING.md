# Tone & Writing Guide - Dungeon Farmers

**"Gaming Parody First, Corporate Flavor Second"**

---

## 🎯 Tone Hierarchy

### PRIMARY (70%): Gaming/RPG/Gacha Parody
Lovingly mock MMO grinds, gacha mechanics, LitRPG tropes, and pop culture. Characters have personality, quirks, and absurd traits. Heroes complain, make memes, have drama. This is the MAIN voice.

### SECONDARY (20%): Character Personality
Heroes are people with personalities, not corporate drones. They're sarcastic, neurotic, chaotic, romantic, dramatic. Let them be messy humans in a fantasy world.

### TERTIARY (10%): Corporate Flavor (Optional)
Light corporate framing for UI/system messages ONLY (tutorial, level-ups, system notifications). NOT for heroes, traits, events, or story content.

---

## 📝 Core Tone Pillars

### Pillar 1: Self-Aware Gaming Parody
**Purpose:** Mock gaming tropes while being a good game

**Examples:**
- Hero trait: **"Gacha Addict"** - Pulls for waifus at 3AM, knows pity systems by heart, wallet screaming
- Event: **"Went Viral"** - Your hero's embarrassing dungeon wipe became a meme. -50% reputation, +100% fame
- Monster: **"Pay-to-Win Whale"** - This boss literally bought better gear than you. Unfair? Yes. Funny? Also yes.

### Pillar 2: Character-Driven Humor
**Purpose:** Heroes are PEOPLE with quirks, not corporate employees

**Examples:**
- Hero voice: **"Thrain (ADHD Chaos)"** - "Wait what were we doing? Oh right dragon. No wait, shiny rock. DRAGON RIGHT."
- Relationship: **"Power Couple"** - Disgustingly in love, +35% stats together, team wants to vomit
- Trait reaction: **"Caffeine Elemental"** - *slams 5th espresso* "I CAN SEE THROUGH TIME"

### Pillar 3: Pop Culture & Internet Culture
**Purpose:** Embrace modern gaming culture and memes (tastefully)

**Examples:**
- Hero dialogue: **"Speedrunner"** - "Chat, we're going for world record. Skip cutscenes, abuse glitches, no bathroom breaks."
- Event: **"Touch Grass Moment"** - Your Chronically Online hero accidentally went outside. Sunlight deals psychic damage.
- Monster behavior: **"Discord Mod"** - Bans you from the dungeon for "violating community guidelines"

## 🎭 Voice by Content Type

### Hero Traits (PRIMARY: Gaming Parody)
Heroes have PERSONALITY and QUIRKS. Make them weird, relatable, chaotic.

✅ **Gaming/Character Voice:**
> **"ADHD Chaos"** - +50% multitasking, +40% creativity, -40% focus, +500% "wait what was I doing" moments. Hyperfixates on shiny loot mid-combat. Forgets boss mechanics. Everyone loves them anyway.

✅ **Gaming/Character Voice:**
> **"Disaster Bisexual"** - +30% charm, +400% romantic chaos. Falls in love with half the team, the dragon, AND the shopkeeper. Relationship drama generator. Finger guns at inappropriate times.

❌ **Wrong (Too Corporate):**
> **"Attention Management Deficit"** - Employee requires additional supervision during task execution. Productivity metrics inconsistent. HR has been notified.

### Hero Dialogue (PRIMARY: Character Personality)
Heroes talk like PEOPLE, not employees. Let them be sarcastic, dramatic, chaotic.

✅ **Character Voice:**
> **Thrain:** "Another dragon? Bro I'm TIRED. My therapist says I have 'hero burnout.' Can we reschedule the apocalypse?"

✅ **Character Voice:**
> **Lyra:** "If one more person asks me to 'check my build' I'm going feral. My build is CHAOS and it works."

❌ **Wrong (Too Corporate):**
> **Thrain:** "Received assignment. Dragon elimination scheduled. Expect overtime compensation."

### Events & Stories (PRIMARY: Gaming Parody)
Mock gaming tropes, create drama, embrace chaos.

✅ **Gaming Parody:**
> **"Went Viral"** - Your hero's epic dungeon fail got 2M views on FantasyTube. Everyone recognizes them now. +100% fame, -50% dignity, can't go anywhere without being memed.

✅ **Gaming Parody:**
> **"Touch Grass Moment"** - Your Chronically Online hero accidentally experienced... outside? The sun?? Grass??? Taking 10 psychic damage per minute. Retreating to basement.

❌ **Wrong (Too Generic):**
> **"Public Recognition Event"** - Your actions have been documented. Reputation adjusted accordingly.

### System Messages (TERTIARY: Corporate Flavor OK)
Tutorial, level-ups, UI messages can use light corporate framing.

✅ **Corporate Flavor (System UI):**
> "New hire onboarding complete: Thrain Ironfist. Benefits package includes healing potions (healthcare) and 401k (gold contributions). Welcome aboard."

✅ **Corporate Flavor (System UI):**
> "Expedition concluded. Performance review: B+ (acceptable). Submit expense reports within 3 business days."

✅ **Gaming Parody (Also Good):**
> "Congrats, you leveled up! Your hero is now slightly less likely to die horribly. +5 to all stats. Still gonna die eventually though."

---

## ✅ Writing Examples by Context

### Tutorial Text
**Use:** Mix of gaming parody + light corporate (player is "new guild manager")

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody Primary):**
> "Welcome to guild management! Your predecessor got eaten by a dragon. Awkward. Anyway, here's a team of weirdos. Send them to fight things. Try not to let them die (they're expensive to replace)."

✅ **Good (Corporate Secondary):**
> "Welcome to your new position. Your employee handbook is in the Guild Hall. First assignment: gather wood from the forest. Remember to log your hours."

❌ **Avoid (Too Serious):**
> "Welcome, brave hero! Your destiny awaits! The kingdom needs you!"

### Hero Recruitment
**Use:** Character personality first, traits should feel REAL

✅ **Good (Character Focus):**
> "THRAIN 'DISASTER' IRONFIST joined your guild! He's a tank with ADHD, caffeine addiction, and bisexual chaos energy. Already flirting with 3 teammates. This'll be fine."

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody):**
> "New hero unlocked: LYRA THE FERAL. Traits: Theater Kid Energy, Chronically Online, Eats Rocks. She WILL cause drama. Team morale -20%. Entertainment value +500%."

❌ **Avoid (Too Corporate):**
> "New hire onboarding complete: Employee #4782. Assigned to Tank Division. Benefits processed."

### Equipment Descriptions
**Use:** Gaming parody, mock loot grind culture

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody):**
> **Dragon Slayer Sword (Epic)** - Finally dropped after 47 runs. You're crying. It's beautiful. +65 ATK, +Fire Damage. Literally on fire. Don't touch the pointy end.

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody):**
> **Boots of Blinding Speed (Legendary)** - +90% movement speed, -100% vision. You're VERY fast and VERY blind. Running into walls has never been more efficient!

⚠️ **OK (Corporate Flavor):**
> **Dragon Slayer Sword (Epic)** - Company-issued equipment. Return to HR upon termination. +65 ATK. Fire damage compliance certified.

### Personal Dungeons
**Use:** Gaming parody (mock dungeon building games)

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody):**
> "You built a dungeon! It's full of goblins and bad vibes. Estimated loot: 2,400 gold. Estimated hero deaths: 0.5 (someone's gonna get hurt). Durability: 15 runs before it falls apart."

⚠️ **OK (Corporate Flavor):**
> "Facility construction complete: Goblin Warren (Uncommon). Operational capacity: 12 cycles. ROI projections available in quarterly report."

### Alliance/Social
**Use:** Gaming culture (guild drama, raid coordination)

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody):**
> "Alliance raid starting in 5 minutes! 3-5 players needed. Voice chat mandatory (good luck). Loot rolls will cause drama. Someone will disconnect. This is fine."

✅ **Good (Gaming Parody):**
> "Your alliance leader started drama in global chat. Everyone's mad. Alliance members taking sides. +100% guild activity, -50% rationality. Popcorn recommended."

⚠️ **OK (Corporate Flavor):**
> "Cross-departmental collaboration scheduled: Dragon's Lair (Beginner). Required personnel: 3-5. Submit participation confirmation by EOD."

## 🚫 What to Avoid

### Never Do This:
- ❌ Force corporate voice on everything (only use for UI/system messages)
- ❌ Make heroes sound like employees instead of people
- ❌ Remove personality from traits and dialogue
- ❌ Generic fantasy ("Hark! The dragon threatens!")
- ❌ Overly excited mobile game spam ("OMG LEGENDARY!!! 😂🔥💯")
- ❌ Breaking fourth wall constantly ("This is just a game lol")

### Tone Balance Examples:

❌ **Too Corporate (Wrong):**
> "Employee #4782 (Thrain) has submitted incident report regarding dragon encounter. Performance metrics: Acceptable. Overtime compensation approved."

❌ **Too Generic Fantasy (Wrong):**
> "The brave warrior Thrain valiantly faced the fearsome dragon, his courage unwavering in the face of certain doom!"

❌ **Too Silly (Wrong):**
> "LOL Thrain fought a dragon and it was WILD! 😂🔥 Epic gamer moment!!!"

✅ **CORRECT (Gaming Parody + Character):**
> "Thrain fought a dragon. Mid-combat his ADHD kicked in and he got distracted by a shiny rock. Somehow still won. The dragon is confused. The team is concerned. Thrain found a cool rock."

## ✅ Tone Consistency Checklist

**Before writing content, ask:**

### For Hero Traits/Dialogue:
1. ✅ Does this sound like a PERSON with personality?
2. ✅ Is it funny because of character quirks, not corporate jargon?
3. ✅ Would a player WANT this hero on their team?
4. ✅ Does it mock gaming tropes in a loving way?
5. ✅ Is corporate voice ABSENT (unless it's a joke trait)?

### For System Messages:
1. ✅ Is this a UI/tutorial/system message? (Then corporate OK)
2. ✅ Is it dry and understated (not excited)?
3. ✅ Does it treat absurdity seriously?
4. ✅ Would it fit in an office memo?

### For Events/Stories:
1. ✅ Does this mock a gaming trope or pop culture?
2. ✅ Is it self-aware but not cynical?
3. ✅ Would players screenshot this and share it?
4. ✅ Is it funny without being mean-spirited?

> *mid-combat* "Has anyone seen my shield? I had it a second ago. No wait that's a rock. Why do I have a rock. Oh right, ADHD. DRAGON RIGHT, FOCUSING."

> *flirting with teammate* "Hey Morrigan, nice spell rotation. Your DPS is almost as impressive as your— *gets hit by dragon* OW. Worth it."

## 🎬 Writing Philosophy

### The Goal:
Make players laugh, feel connected to their heroes, and want to share screenshots of absurd moments.

### The Method:
- **Heroes are PEOPLE** - Let them be chaotic, romantic, dramatic, weird
- **Gaming culture is PRIMARY** - Mock MMO grinds, gacha mechanics, LitRPG tropes
- **Corporate is SEASONING** - Light flavor for system messages, not the main dish
- **Self-aware, not cynical** - Love the genre while mocking it

### The Test:
**Would a player screenshot this and send it to their friends?**
- If yes → You nailed it
- If no → Needs more personality/humor/gaming culture

---

## 🎯 Final Guidelines

**Golden Rule:**
> "What would a chaotic RPG party say if they were aware they're in an idle game that mocks gaming culture?"

**Priority Order:**
1. **Character personality** (heroes are people first)
2. **Gaming parody** (mock the genre lovingly)
3. **Corporate flavor** (optional, system messages only)

**Remember:**
- Corporate voice is 10% seasoning, not the main ingredient
- Heroes talk like people, not employees
- Gaming culture and memes are your friends
- Self-aware ≠ breaking fourth wall constantly
- Funny > perfect

**This guide ensures Dungeon Farmers maintains its unique gaming parody voice with character-driven humor, using corporate satire as optional flavor rather than forced framework.**
