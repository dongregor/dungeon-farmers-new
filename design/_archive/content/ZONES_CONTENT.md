- Zones 1-5: Tutorial/Easy (gentle introduction)
- Zones 6-10: Normal/Hard (core gameplay loop)
- Zones 11-13: Very Hard (gear check, commitment required)
- Zones 14-15: Nightmare (endgame, mastery required)

### Parody Balance
- 70% Gaming/RPG parody (MMO grinds, gacha mechanics, LitRPG)
- 20% Corporate satire (optional flavor, not overwhelming)
- 10% Character personality (monster quirks, NPC awareness)

### Reward Scaling
- Gold: Linear increase (20g → 2000g)
- XP: Exponential curve (matches level requirements)
- Materials: Rarity increases with zone difficulty
- Mythic drops: 1-5% in endgame zones only

### Duration Philosophy
- Early zones: 5-25 min (quick sessions)
- Mid zones: 30-75 min (committed sessions)
- Late zones: 90-180 min (deep idle farming)
