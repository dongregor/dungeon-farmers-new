- Higher rarity heroes more likely to have 5 traits

### Numerical Trait Ranges
Traits with numerical effects (e.g., "Coffee Addict: +10-15% SPD") roll a specific value within that range at recruitment:
- Common: ±2% variance
- Uncommon: ±3% variance
- Rare: ±5% variance
- Epic: ±8% variance
- Legendary: ±10% variance

Example: "Coffee Addict" might roll +12% SPD (within 10-15% range)

### Conflict Resolution
When traits conflict (e.g., Early Bird vs Night Owl), hero cannot have both. Recruitment algorithm prevents conflicts.

### Synergy Bonuses
When complementary traits are present (e.g., Coffee Addict + Caffeine Dependent), add additional +2-5% synergy bonus to shared stat.

### Parody Balance
- 70% Gaming/RPG references (grinding, RNG, minmaxing)
- 20% Corporate satire (work culture, meetings, burnout)
- 10% Personality quirks (introverts, optimists, procrastinators)
