## GAME MECHANICS TIPS (Gaming/RPG Parody)

### RNG & Drop Rates
- "Tip: The 0.6% drop rate is accurate (legally required transparency). Good luck!"
- "Rare drops have a 1% chance. You'll get it on run #473. We're sorry."
- "Fun Fact: RNGesus is real and accepts prayers (results may vary)."
- "Remember: Past RNG results don't affect future rolls (the gambler's fallacy is strong)."
- "Tip: If you complain in chat, drop rates don't improve (we tested this)."
- "The Shiny Slime has a 1/8192 spawn rate. This is not a Pokémon reference (it totally is)."
- "Drop rate transparency: 0.6% means you'll see it once per 167 runs (on average) (bring snacks)."
- "Tip: Lucky heroes don't actually improve drop rates... or do they? (They do, +5%.)"

### Grinding & Farming
- "Reminder: The grind is the game. The game is the grind. Welcome."
- "You've killed 10,000 slimes. The next 10,000 will be exactly the same. This is your life now."
- "Fun Fact: This zone has been farmed 2.4 million times. You're part of history!"
- "Tip: Efficiency is measured in gold per minute. Fun is not measured (it's irrelevant)."
- "The Grinding Grounds has a 12% efficiency rating. This is considered industry-leading."
- "Remember: Time spent grinding is time well spent (citation needed)."
- "Tip: If you're not grinding, you're falling behind (this is a lie, touch grass)."
- "Fun Fact: The average player has run this zone 500 times. Above average? 2,000 times."

### Tutorials & New Players
- "Tip: Slimes are the tutorial enemy in 87% of RPGs. We're part of a proud tradition."
- "Welcome to the Tutorial Plains! You'll be here for 5 minutes. Some players never leave (therapy recommended)."
- "Remember: Skipping tutorials causes confusion. Reading tutorials causes boredom. Choose wisely."
- "Fun Fact: Tutorial completion rate: 94%. Tutorial retention rate: 12% (they forgot immediately)."
- "Tip: If you die in the tutorial zone, the game will never let you forget it."
- "The tutorial is designed for 5-year-olds. You're an adult (allegedly). You'll still need it."

### Game Balance & Patches
- "Patch Notes: Slime HP reduced by 2. This will fix everything (it won't)."
- "Tip: This build is broken (we know). Nerf incoming (next patch). Enjoy it while it lasts."
- "Balance philosophy: Everything is overpowered until someone complains loudly enough."
- "Reminder: Developers read your feedback (they cry, but they read it)."
- "Fun Fact: The most complained-about feature is the most-used feature (irony is dead)."
- "Tip: Every patch breaks something new. This is tradition (bug fix: creates 3 new bugs)."

### Power Scaling & Stats
- "Remember: Gear score is 30-40% of your power. The rest is false confidence."
- "Tip: +1% stat increase feels meaningless. Over 100 items, it's +100%. Math!"
- "Power rating is calculated using: [REDACTED]. Trust the system."
- "Fun Fact: The highest power rating is 47,582 (player name: TouchGrassNever420)."
- "Tip: You can beat content 200 power below recommended (if you're good) (you're not) (gear up)."

### Expeditions & Dungeons
- "Tip: Expeditions always succeed. Performance affects rewards (60-150%). No failure states!"
- "Efficiency formula: Team Power ÷ Recommended Power × 100. Capped at 150%. You're welcome."
- "Remember: Time remaining is SERVER-SIDE. Don't try to cheat (we're watching)."
- "Fun Fact: The longest expedition is 180 minutes. The shortest: 5 minutes. Plan accordingly."
- "Tip: You can run expeditions while offline. This game respects your time (unlike your job)."

### Monster Capture
- "Capture rates range from 5-15%. Lower than Pokémon. Higher than your boss's approval."
- "Tip: Monsters captured can be assigned to your personal dungeons (unique feature!)."
- "Remember: Captured monsters can be reassigned after 24-hour cooldown (union-mandated)."
- "Fun Fact: The rarest monster has a 0.5% capture rate. Good luck (you'll need it)."
- "Tip: Shiny monsters exist. They're functionally identical but sparkly (collectors lose their minds)."

### Equipment Sets
- "Set bonuses activate at 2, 4, and 6 pieces. Full sets are build-defining (and fashionable)."
- "Tip: Mix-matching sets is viable. Don't let the meta police you (but they're probably right)."
- "Remember: That Common weapon from level 5? Vendor it. You don't need 400 of them."
- "Fun Fact: The Shadow Stalker set grants anime protagonist hair physics (not joking)."
- "Tip: Equipment with lower gear score can be better if set bonuses align. Math is hard."

## CORPORATE SATIRE TIPS (Work Culture Humor)

### Meetings & Management

- "Fun Fact: The average meeting length in Middle Management Marsh is 4 hours (2 productive minutes)."

- "Remember: If you're not early, you're late (this is passive-aggressive judgment)."
- "Tip: Stand-up meetings should take 15 minutes. Reality: 60 minutes. Someone is monologuing."

- "Tip: Work-life balance is a myth propagated by people who don't grind hard enough (touch grass)."

### Corporate Buzzwords
- "Synergy Detected: +5% team stats (synergy means nothing but sounds impressive)."

- "Paradigm shift achieved! Nothing actually changed. Business as usual."
- "Fun Fact: Buzzword density in C-Suite Citadel: 47 buzzwords per sentence (efficiency: 0%)."

### Performance Reviews

- "Fun Fact: 0.6% of performance reviews result in meaningful change (like our drop rates)."

### Compensation & Salary

- "Fun Fact: This company has pivoted 47 times. Original vision: unknown."

### Coffee Culture
