## Phase 0: First Login (0-5 minutes)

### The Hook - Clean Welcome

Player arrives at clean, professional landing screen with minimal friction:
- **[Create New Guild]** button (no account barriers)
- **Tone established immediately**: Modern, readable UI with playful RPG parody (corporate flavor is *optional seasoning* in system/UI copy)
- **Promise visible**: "Build your weird little adventuring guild (and make it efficient if you want)"

### Character Creation - FAST & NO REGRETS

**Screen 1: Guild Name**
- Simple text input with suggested names
- Optional tabard color selection (cosmetic only)
- **NO excessive customization** (respects time principle)

**Screen 2: Choose Your First Hero**
- **Only 3 hero options** (prevents analysis paralysis)
- **All three equally viable** (no trap choices)
- Clear visual and mechanical differences

**Hero Choices:**
1. **THERON** (Warrior) - Balanced stats, HP/ATK focus, Tags: Stalwart + Leader
2. **LYRA** (Ranger) - High ATK/SPD, low DEF, Tags: Swift + Precise
3. **MAGNUS** (Mage) - Magic damage, defensive, Tags: Arcane + Wise

**Key Design Decision**: Stats shown as simple visual indicators (stars), tags introduced immediately with tooltips. Player knows they can recruit others later (reduces FOMO).

**❓ [QUESTION]**: Should guild creation include guild master character customization (appearance, name) or focus purely on first hero selection?

## Phase 1: Tutorial - First Expedition (5-15 minutes)

### Guild Hall Introduction

**First impression matters:**
- Clean interface with visual hierarchy
- Locked features visible but grayed out (creates curiosity)
- **EXPEDITIONS** tab highlighted with "!NEW!" marker
- Tutorial guide voice: Friendly but professional (no condescension)

### First Expedition - Whispering Woods (Guided)

**Setup:**
- Duration: **2 minutes** (intentionally short for quick dopamine loop)
- Team Size: 1 hero
- Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆ (Trivial - guaranteed success)
- Power Check: "Your Power: 45 / 30 needed ✓"

**Player Learns:**
- Team selection interface
- Power rating system (clear feedback)
- Expedition duration = real-time waiting
- Basic resource types (Gold, Wood, Experience)

### While Waiting (Tutorial Exploration)

**Tutorial encourages exploring HEROES menu:**
- Character sheet breakdown
- Tags and their strategic meanings (tooltips)
- Equipment slots (grayed out - foreshadowing)
- **"Recruit Heroes"** button locked with tooltip: "Unlock at Player Level 2"

**Emotional beat**: Anticipation building, player discovers systems organically.

### First Reward Loop - CRITICAL DOPAMINE HIT #1

**After 2 minutes, expedition completes:**
- Animated loot chest opening (satisfying visual)
- Multiple rewards shown simultaneously:
  - **Gold +50**
  - **Wood +10**
  - **Rusty Dagger** (Common equipment - NEW!)
  - **Experience +80**
- **🎉 THERON LEVELED UP! Lv 1 → Lv 2**

**Why this matters**: Immediate level-up + first equipment drop = powerful dopamine hit within 2 minutes of gameplay.

### Equipment Tutorial

**New item popup forces engagement:**
- Stats clearly displayed: **+5 ATK**
- **[EQUIP ON THERON]** button (one-click action)
- Power increases: **45 → 50** (visible progress)
- Success animation reinforces positive action

**Player learns**: Equipment = power increase = better expedition performance.

### Second Expedition - Rocky Foothills

**Unlocks immediately after first completion:**
- Duration: **5 minutes** (slightly longer, testing patience)
- Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆ (Easy)
- Team Size: Still 1 hero
- **NEW tooltip**: "Small chance: Capture a monster! 🎲"

**Emotional beat**: Curiosity created - "What's a monster? Why capture it?"

### Monster Capture - DOPAMINE HIT #2

**After 5-minute completion, special event:**
- **✨ THERON CAPTURED A MONSTER! ✨**
- **Stone Goblin** obtained
- Power: 15, Type: Melee Fighter
- Loot table preview shown (Stone, Stone Shard)

**Tutorial Tease:**
> "Monsters can be used to create Personal Dungeons for efficient farming. You'll unlock this feature soon!"

**Why this matters**: Rare event (5-15% chance) creates excitement. Teases core unique mechanic without overwhelming player.

**Player emotion**: "That was cool! I want to capture more. What are personal dungeons?"

### Personal Dungeon System Preview (Demo Tutorial) - DOPAMINE HIT #2.5

**After monster capture, tutorial introduces locked feature:**

**🎯 PERSONAL DUNGEONS (PREMIUM FEATURE) 🎯**

**What You Just Did:**
- ✨ Captured **Stone Goblin** (Power: 15, Type: Melee Fighter)
- 📦 Monster stored in collection

**What Personal Dungeons Do:**
- Build custom farming dungeons using captured monsters
- Assign monsters to schematic slots to create functional dungeons
- Farm dungeons for targeted, predictable resources (3-5 min runs vs 10-60 min zones)
- Optimize resource generation through strategic monster assignment

**Visual Preview Shown:**
- Example schematic: "Goblin Warren" (3 rooms, 2 goblin slots + 1 boss slot)
- Example dungeon: Stone Goblin + Goblin Warrior assigned = 55 Power dungeon
- Expected rewards preview: Stone, Stone Chunk, Iron Ore, Gold
- Durability indicator: 10 runs (not time-limited!)

**Demo Restriction Explanation:**
> "Personal Dungeon Building is a Premium feature. In the demo, you can capture monsters and collect schematics, but dungeon construction requires the full game. **Upgrade to unlock unlimited dungeon building and the complete game experience!**"

**Upgrade CTA Displayed:**
- "Upgrade to Unlock Personal Dungeons" button
- Preview of premium benefits (all zones, unlimited heroes, alliance raids)

**Why this matters**: Players understand the unique value proposition while building upgrade motivation. Clear explanation of system's uniqueness without overwhelming complexity.

### Missions vs Zones - Strategic Understanding

**Story Mission appears: "Goblin Trouble"**
- Duration: 15 minutes
- **Guaranteed rewards** (different from RNG zones)
- Guaranteed monster capture: **Goblin Warrior**
- Story context provided (light narrative)

**Player learns critical difference:**
- **Zones** = Repeatable, RNG rewards, monster capture chance
- **Missions** = Story-driven, guaranteed specific rewards

**Emotional beat**: Player realizes there are multiple strategic paths (not just grinding one zone repeatedly).

### Equipment Sets Introduction

**First set item drops:**
- "Guardian's Oath Boots (1/4)"
- Set bonus preview shown:
  - **2 pieces**: +10% Defense
  - **4 pieces**: +20% Defense + 5% HP Regen

  - **Durability: 10 runs** (NOT time-limited!)

**Emotional beat**: "I BUILT something! And it's mine to use whenever I want!"

3. **Personal Dungeons**: **Fast targeted farming**, uses captured monsters, durability-based

## Key Design Principles Applied

### From Player Research Findings

✅ **No energy systems** - Play as much or as little as you want
✅ **No VIP tiers** - QoL features available to everyone (no pay-for-convenience)
✅ **Meaningful progression** - Always moving forward, no failure states
✅ **Respect player time** - Quick 5-min check-ins OR deep 2-hour sessions both valid
✅ **Fair monetization** - Cosmetics only, no pay-to-win mechanics
✅ **Social without pressure** - Alliance benefits available, but solo play totally viable
✅ **Content creation loop** - Personal dungeons give players agency and creativity
✅ **Clear goals** - Collections, equipment sets, visible progression paths
✅ **Dopamine hits** - Regular rewards at all engagement levels (casual to hardcore)

### Avoided Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns)

❌ **No arbitrary time gates** - Expeditions have real durations, but no "wait 24 hours to continue"
❌ **No required duplicates** - All heroes viable without dupes (no gacha trap)
❌ **No FOMO pressure** - Events return annually, cosmetics don't affect power
❌ **No pay-only content** - Everything accessible through gameplay
❌ **No forced PvP** - Competitive leaderboards optional, cooperation encouraged
❌ **No punishing failure states** - Efficiency variance (60-100%+) instead of complete failure
❌ **No daily grind burnout** - Quick sessions valid, offline progress meaningful

---

## Why This Journey Works

### Gradual Complexity Introduction
Systems introduced one at a time:
1. Expeditions (first 5 min)
2. Equipment (after first completion)
3. Monster capture (second expedition)
4. Multi-hero teams (30 min in)
5. Personal dungeons (2-5 hours in)
6. Alliances (5-10 hours in)
7. Ascension (20+ hours in)

**Player never feels overwhelmed.**

### Constant Rewards
Something new every session:
- Immediate: Expedition loot, equipment drops
- Short-term: Daily quests, dungeon farms
- Medium-term: Set completion, monster captures
- Long-term: Collection milestones, ascension

**Player always has a reason to log in.**

### Clear Milestones
Visible progress markers:
- Player level (1-50+)
- Power rating (visible number)
- Collection percentages (45/100 heroes)
- Set bonuses (2/4, 4/4 complete)
- Alliance contributions (raid participation)

**Player sees tangible growth.**

### Strategic Depth
Multiple viable paths:
- Focus on zones for monster captures
- Focus on missions for guaranteed rewards
- Focus on personal dungeons for efficient farming
- Focus on alliances for social benefits
- Focus on collections for completion rewards

**No single "correct" strategy.**

### Social Integration
Alliance content feels natural:
- Passive bonuses (always active)
- Optional raids (3-5 players, not entire alliance)
- Real-time chat (build friendships)
- Shared goals (alliance level progression)

**Social play enhances but doesn't gatekeep.**

### Player Agency
Personal dungeons = creative expression:
- Choose which monsters to assign
- Optimize loot tables
- Balance durability vs power
- Experiment with schematic combinations

**Players build their own content.**

### Long-Term Goals
Collection completion drives engagement:
- 100 unique heroes to recruit
- 150 monster species to capture
- 50 dungeon schematics to collect
- 30 equipment sets to complete

**Months of meaningful progression.**

### Respect for Time
Offline progress matters:
- 8-hour expeditions while sleeping
- Alliance bonuses always active
- Personal dungeons don't expire (durability-based)
- No "check in every 4 hours or lose progress"

**Players play on THEIR schedule.**

---

**The journey ensures players learn systems without overwhelm, always have meaningful choices, and experience the unique monster capture + personal dungeon loop that differentiates Dungeon Farmers from the saturated idle RPG market.**
