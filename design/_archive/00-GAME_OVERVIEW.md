## 📖 Terminology & Glossary

### Core Game Terms

**Personal Dungeons**: Player-created dungeon instances built using Schematics and captured Monsters. These are the game's unique differentiator, allowing players to create optimized farming content.

**Efficiency Variance**: The 60-150% performance outcome range for expeditions and dungeon runs. Determines reward quantity based on team composition, equipment, and strategic choices. (Parody of gacha "SSS Rank" systems, but without the frustration)

**Schematic**: Blueprint for building a personal dungeon. Defines monster slot requirements (e.g., "3x Melee + 2x Caster"), dungeon layout, and reward types. Collected through expeditions, raids, and story missions. (Parodies "crafting recipe" hoarding in MMOs)

**Alliance Points**: Currency earned through alliance activities (raids, donations, participation). Used in alliance shop for exclusive rewards. (Mocks endless "guild tokens" from MMOs)

**Capture Rate**: Probability of capturing a monster during expeditions. Base rate varies by monster rarity and expedition difficulty (5-15% typical range). Affected by hero traits and equipment bonuses. (Gentle parody of "0.6% SSR rates" - but actually fair)

**Durability**: Lifespan of a personal dungeon measured in runs (10-20 depending on schematic rarity). Once durability reaches zero, the dungeon must be rebuilt with new monster assignments. (References "weapon durability" from Zelda/Dark Souls, applied to dungeons)

**Set Bonus**: Equipment effect activated when wearing multiple pieces from the same set. Provides stat bonuses and special effects at 2-piece, 4-piece, and 6-piece thresholds. (Classic MMO/Diablo mechanic, no parody needed - it's fun)

**Trait**: Passive ability or characteristic that defines hero personality and provides gameplay effects. Each hero has 3-5 traits with rarities from Common to Legendary. Examples: "Main Character Energy", "NPC Awareness", "Tutorial Skipper".

**Personality Dimensions** (Phase 2+): Five core personality axes (0-10 scale) that determine hero behavior and event probabilities: Sociability (Loner ↔ Social Butterfly), Work Ethic (Relaxed ↔ Workaholic), Risk Tolerance (Cautious ↔ Thrill-Seeker), Competitiveness (Team Player ↔ Solo Glory), Seriousness (Goofy ↔ Professional). Affects story event generation and team dynamics.

**Morale/Happiness** (Phase 2+): Hero mood state (0-100 scale) ranging from Burnout (0-14, refuses missions) to Inspired (85-100, +15% stats). Affected by mission outcomes, equipment upgrades, personality preferences, and management decisions. Creates dynamic "employee wellness" gameplay with corporate satire framing ("HR alerts", "mandatory PTO", "performance reviews").

**Tag**: Hero ability category used for expedition requirements and team synergies. Examples: Fire Magic, Healing, Stealth, AoE Damage. Heroes have 1-3 tags that define their strategic role. (RPG classic, works as-is)

**Familiarity**: Bonus system for repeated zone expeditions. Heroes gain +1% damage per clear (max +50%), encouraging specialization while maintaining flexibility. (Parodies "farming the same dungeon 1000 times" MMO trope - but makes it beneficial)

**Retirement/Ascension** (In-game: "Early Retirement Program"): Prestige system where level 50 heroes reset to level 1 with enhanced base stats and exclusive bonuses.

**Personal Dungeon** (In-game: "Personal Resource Development Initiative" or "Revenue Stream #X"): Player-created farming content with "quarterly earnings reports" (resource generation tracking).

### System-Specific Terms

**Monster Families**: Categorization of monsters by type (Beast, Undead, Elemental, Humanoid, Dragon, Demon, Construct). Used for dungeon synergy bonuses when assigning monsters of the same family to schematic slots.

**Synergy Bonus**: Reward multiplier (5-25%) gained when personal dungeons use monsters from the same family or meet thematic requirements.

**Affix** (Phase 4): Prefix/suffix modifiers on Rare+ equipment providing additional random stats. Examples: "Blazing" (+Fire Damage), "Sturdy" (+Defense).

**Enchant Slot** (Phase 4): Socket on Legendary+ equipment for customizable bonuses. Players can insert enchants for specific stat boosts or effects.

**Mythic Variant** (Phase 4): Rare procedurally-generated monster subtype with unique visual variants and enhanced power (110-130% base stats). Example: "Frost-Touched Orc" instead of standard "Orc Warrior".

**Gear Score**: Numerical representation of equipment power (1-1000+). Contributes ~30-40% of total hero power, with the remainder from base stats, traits, and set bonuses.

**Ascension Path** (Phase 3+): Specialization choice during prestige. Options include Offensive (damage-focused), Defensive (survivability), or Balanced (hybrid approach).

**Alliance Raid Tier**: Difficulty classification for cooperative content. Tiers: Beginner (3-5 players, lower requirements), Intermediate (coordination required), Advanced (optimized teams), Elite (endgame challenge).

**Slot Requirement**: Schematic constraint defining monster types needed to build a personal dungeon. Example: "2x Tank + 1x Healer + 2x DPS". Monsters must match archetype or family to fill slots.

## ✨ Unique Selling Proposition

### The Hook: Monster Capture + Personal Dungeon Building

**What makes Dungeon Farmers different from every other idle RPG?**

**The Self-Sustaining Content Loop:**

1. **Capture Monsters**: During expeditions (zones, missions), heroes have a 5-15% chance to capture monsters
2. **Collect Schematics**: Find dungeon blueprints that define monster slot requirements (e.g., "3x Melee + 2x Caster")
3. **Build Personal Dungeons**: Assign captured monsters to schematic slots to create functioning dungeons
4. **Farm Optimized Resources**: Run personal dungeons (durability-based, 10-20 runs) for targeted resource farming
5. **Progress Heroes**: Use resources to level/equip heroes for harder content
6. **Capture Rarer Monsters**: Tackle harder expeditions to get better monsters
7. **Build Better Dungeons**: Create more optimized dungeons with rare monsters

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Solves **content starvation** (idle game's biggest problem)
- ✅ Gives **player creativity** and ownership
- ✅ Creates **strategic optimization** gameplay
- ✅ Provides **long-term engagement** without developer content sprints
- ✅ Differentiates from **all competitors**

## 🌍 Game World & Tone

### Setting
**Fantasy guild management (with an optional corporate UI wrapper)** — At its core, this is a classic “weird adventurers doing weird quests” world. The corporate satire is a **presentation layer** (UI labels, tooltips, system notifications), not the heroes’ identity.

### Tone: Gaming Parody First (Corporate as Seasoning)
- **Primary**: Gaming/RPG/gacha parody (loving genre mockery)
- **Secondary**: Character voice (heroes sound like people, not employees)
- **Seasoning**: Corporate framing for **system/UI text only** (optional “HR mode” vibe, never mandatory)

**Example Flavor Text:**
- Hero trait: **"Caffeine Dependent"** - +25% damage after consuming potions, -15% before coffee
- Expedition: **"Team-Up Raid"** (Alliance Raid) - "Bring friends. Someone will disconnect. You'll still win."
- Personal Dungeon: **"Goblin Money Pit"** - "Predictable loot. Unpredictable goblins. Durability: 12 runs."

### Target Audience Psychographic
**"The Exhausted Gacha Player"**
- Spent $100-$10,000+ on mobile gacha games (regrets it)
- Wants strategic depth without predatory monetization
- Values time (busy adult, 25-45 years old)
- Appreciates humor and self-awareness
- Seeks long-term progression without FOMO pressure
- Willing to pay upfront for fair game

## 🎨 Visual & UI Design Philosophy

### Clean & Informative
- **No clutter** - Clear visual hierarchy

   - **Rationale**: Balances engagement with player agency, prevents instant min-maxing while maintaining flexibility
   - **See**: [systems/MONSTER_DUNGEON_SYSTEM.md](systems/MONSTER_DUNGEON_SYSTEM.md) for full details

### Alliance Raids
3. **❓ [QUESTION]**: Exact difficulty scaling for 3-5 players?
   - **Current plan**: Raids scale based on participant count
   - **Need to define**: Exact power requirements and reward scaling
   - **Proposal**: 3 players = 100% difficulty, 4 players = 120%, 5 players = 150% (more players = harder but more rewards)

### Endgame Progression
4. **❓ [QUESTION]**: Prestige system beyond Ascension?
   - **Current plan**: Ascension at level 50 (reset to level 1 with boosted stats)
   - **Unclear**: Is there a second prestige tier? Multiple ascensions?
   - **Proposal**: Single Ascension (simpler), future expansion can add "Guild Rank" prestige system

### Content Cadence
5. **✅ RESOLVED**: Post-launch content update schedule
   - **Final decision**: Major updates every 3 months, minor updates monthly, 4 seasonal events per year
   - **Major Updates**: New zones, schematics, monsters (base game systems - FREE)
