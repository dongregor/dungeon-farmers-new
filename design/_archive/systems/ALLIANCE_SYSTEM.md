# Alliance System - Dungeon Farmers

**Social Features Without Pressure - Optional Cooperation**

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Social Benefits. No Mandatory Participation. Solo Play Viable.**

Alliances provide passive bonuses, cooperative raids, and social features WITHOUT making them mandatory for progression.

---

## 🏰 Alliance Structure

### Size & Organization
- **Max 30 members** per alliance
- **Min 5 members** for raid access
- Alliance Leader + Officers (permission management)
- No mandatory participation requirements

### Alliance Levels (1-25)
**Level Up Through:**
- Member contributions (gold, materials)
- Alliance raid completions
- Weekly quest completion

**Level Benefits:**
- Higher passive bonuses
- Access to higher-tier raids
- Better alliance shop offerings

---

## 💰 Passive Bonuses (Always Active)

### Alliance-Wide Buffs
**Scales with alliance level:**

- **+5-15% Gold** (Level 1 → Level 25)
- **+3-10% Experience** (Level 1 → Level 25)
- **+1-5% Rare Drop Rate** (Level 10 → Level 25)

**Design Rationale**: Passive bonuses benefit ALL members, including casuals who don't raid.

## 🐉 Alliance Raids

### Raid Participation
- **3-5 players** (NOT entire alliance)
