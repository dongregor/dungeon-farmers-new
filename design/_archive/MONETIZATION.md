# Monetization Strategy - Dungeon Farmers

**Fair Pay-Once Model Based on Player Research**

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Pay-Once. Cosmetics-Only DLC. No Predatory Mechanics.**

Monetization designed based on exhausted gacha player feedback: "I'd happily pay $10-15 upfront if it meant no energy systems, no VIP tiers, and no pay-to-win."

---

## 💰 Pricing Model

### Free Demo → Premium Unlock

**Free Demo (Unlimited Time)**
- **Level Cap:** 15 (out of 50+)
- **Hero Roster Cap:** 5 heroes
- **Zone Access:** First 3 zones only
- **Personal Dungeons:** **LOCKED** (can view schematics and captured monsters, but cannot build dungeons)
- **Alliance:** Read-only (can browse but not join raids)
- **Crafting:** Disabled
- **Duration:** 10-15 hours of meaningful gameplay

**Demo Philosophy:** Let players experience core loop and fall in love with the game BEFORE asking for money.

**Premium Unlock: $9.99 (One-Time)**
- ✓ Remove level cap (1-50+)
- ✓ Unlimited hero roster
- ✓ All zones unlocked
- ✓ **Personal dungeon building enabled** (THE unique feature)
- ✓ Full alliance participation
- ✓ Crafting system unlocked
- ✓ **All base game content updates included FREE** (see [Future Expansion](#-future-expansion-post-launch) for expansion DLC policy)

**Design Rationale:** $9.99 is impulse-buy territory while respecting player budget constraints. Comparable to a movie ticket or two coffees.

## 🎯 Player Research Findings

### What Players Hate (From Reddit/Discord)
1. **Energy systems** - "I hate being told when I can play"
2. **VIP tiers** - "Pay for convenience is predatory"
3. **Duplicate heroes** - "Needing 5 copies to be viable is trash"
4. **Time-limited FOMO** - "Missed the OP hero, account ruined"
5. **Pay-to-win** - "Whales dominate, F2P players are fodder"

### What Players Want (Direct Quotes)
> "I'd pay $10-15 upfront if it meant no energy, no VIP, no gacha BS."

> "Just sell me the game. I'm so tired of predatory monetization."

> "Give me a demo, let me try it, then charge me fairly. Simple."

> "Cosmetics? Sure, I'll buy those. Just don't lock power behind money."
