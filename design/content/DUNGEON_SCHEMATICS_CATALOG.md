## Schematic Design Philosophy

### Monster Slot Requirements Philosophy
- **Common**: Flexible requirements (any monster type works)
- **Uncommon**: Some specificity (family or archetype preferences)
- **Rare**: Moderate specificity (requires certain families/types)
- **Epic**: High specificity (needs elite monsters, specific builds)
- **Mythic**: Very specific (legendary/mythic monsters, perfect composition)

### Reward Scaling by Rarity
| Rarity | Gold/Run | XP/Run | Equipment Chance | Materials |
|--------|----------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Common | 50-150g | 80-200 | 8-15% | Basic |
| Uncommon | 120-260g | 150-300 | 16-24% | Improved |
| Rare | 320-600g | 350-700 | 25-35% | Great |
| Epic | 580-950g | 650-1000 | 28-40% | Excellent |
| Mythic | 1000-2200g | 1500-3000 | 35-50% | Legendary |

### Durability Philosophy
- **Lower durability** = More frequent rebuilding = More monster variety used
- **Higher rarity** = Higher durability = Longer farming sessions
- **24-hour cooldown** on monster reassignment = Strategic planning required

### Build Cost Scaling
- Common: 25-60g
- Uncommon: 90-150g
- Rare: 280-400g
- Epic: 550-700g
- Mythic: 1200-1800g

### Monster Power Scaling
- Monsters scale to % of team power (not static levels)
- Higher rarity schematics = Higher scaling = Better rewards
- Prevents trivializing content with over-leveled teams
